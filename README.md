# Snake AI Reinforcement Learning

Snake AI Reinforcement Learning is a project that implements a Snake game with AI controlled by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. The AI agent learns to navigate the game environment using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to achieve the highest score possible.

## Features

- **Snake Game:** Classic Snake game with a graphical user interface.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** The AI agent is trained using Deep Q-Learning.
- **Neural Network:** The game utilizes a neural network to make decisions for the AI agent.
- **Game State Representation:** The state of the game is represented as features for input to the RL model.

## Learning Process

Snake AI learning process at different stages:

1. **Beginning of Learning (after 0 episodes):**

Please note that the number of episodes mentioned above (0, 60, 140) is indicative and may vary based on your specific program parameters and learning process.

## Installation

You first need to create an Anaconda environment.
After creating an environment
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/snake-ai.git](https://github.com/RoeeHashai/SnakeAI.git)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Requirements

Python 3.7

## Usage

To start the game and initiate the agent's learning process, use the following command:

```bash
python train_agent_snake.py
```
